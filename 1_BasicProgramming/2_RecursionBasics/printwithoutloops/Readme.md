# Print 1 To N Without Loop

[GeeksforGeeks Link for the Problem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/print-1-to-n-without-using-loops-1587115620/1)

## Problem Statement
Print numbers from 1 to N without the help of loops.

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input:**  
`N = 10`  
**Output:**  
`1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10`  

### Example 2
**Input:**  
`N = 5`  
**Output:**  
`1 2 3 4 5`  

## Your Task
This is a function problem. You only need to complete the function `printNos()` that takes `N` as a parameter and prints numbers from 1 to `N` recursively. Don't print newline, it will be added by the driver code.

## Expected Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(N)
- **Auxiliary Space:** O(N) (Recursive)

## Constraints
- \(1 \leq N \leq 10^5\)
