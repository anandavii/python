[GeeksforGeeks Link for the Problem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/print-gfg-n-times/1)

## Problem Statement
Print GFG n times without using a loop.

## Examples

### Example
**Input:**  
`5`  
**Output:**  
`GFG GFG GFG GFG GFG`  

## Your Task
This is a function problem. You only need to complete the function `printGfg()` that takes `N` as a parameter and prints "GFG" N times recursively. Don't print newline, it will be added by the driver code.

## Expected Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(N)
- **Auxiliary Space:** O(N) (Recursive)

## Constraints
- \(1 \leq N \leq 1000\)
