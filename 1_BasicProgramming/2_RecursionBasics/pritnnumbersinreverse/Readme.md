# Print N to 1 without loop

[GeeksforGeeks Link for the Problem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/print-n-to-1-without-loop/1)

## Problem Statement
Print numbers from N to 1 (space separated) without using a loop.

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input:**  
`N = 10`  
**Output:**  
`10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1`  

## Your Task
This is a function problem. You only need to complete the function `printNos()` that takes `N` as a parameter and prints numbers from `N` to 1 recursively. Don't print newline, it will be added by the driver code.

## Expected Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(N)
- **Auxiliary Space:** O(N) (Recursive)

## Constraints
- \(1 \leq N \leq 1000\)
