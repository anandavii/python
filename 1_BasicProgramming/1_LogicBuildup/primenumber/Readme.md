[GFG Link for the Problem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/prime-number2314/1)

## Problem Statement
For a given number \( N \), check if it is prime or not. A prime number is a number which is only divisible by 1 and itself.

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input:**  
N = 5  
**Output:**  
1  
**Explanation:**  
5 has 2 factors, 1 and 5 only.

### Example 2
**Input:**  
N = 25  
**Output:**  
0  
**Explanation:**  
25 has 3 factors, 1, 5, and 25.

## Your Task
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function `isPrime()` which takes an integer \( N \) as input parameters and returns an integer, 1 if \( N \) is a prime number or 0 otherwise.

## Expected Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(âˆšN)
- **Auxiliary Space:** O(1)

## Constraints
- \( 1 \leq N \leq 10^9 \)

Feel free to modify the function or add additional comments for clarity as needed.
