# LCM and GCD Problem

[GFG Link for the Problem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/lcm-and-gcd4516/1)

## Problem Statement
Given two numbers `A` and `B`, the task is to find their LCM (Least Common Multiple) and GCD (Greatest Common Divisor).

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input:**  
`A = 5`, `B = 10`  
**Output:**  
`10 5`  
**Explanation:**  
LCM of 5 and 10 is 10, while their GCD is 5.

### Example 2
**Input:**  
`A = 14`, `B = 8`  
**Output:**  
`56 2`  
**Explanation:**  
LCM of 14 and 8 is 56, while their GCD is 2.

## Your Task
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function `lcmAndGcd()` which takes two integers `A` and `B` as input and returns a list of two integers: the required LCM and GCD.

## Expected Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(log(min(A, B)))
- **Auxiliary Space:** O(1)

## Constraints
- \(1 \leq A, B \leq 10^9\)

Feel free to modify the function or add additional comments for clarity as needed.
