# Palindrome Number Problem

[Leetcode Link for the Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/description/)

## Problem Statement
Given an integer `x`, return `true` if `x` is a palindrome, and `false` otherwise.

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input:**  
`x = 121`  
**Output:**  
`true`  
**Explanation:**  
121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

### Example 2
**Input:**  
`x = -121`  
**Output:**  
`false`  
**Explanation:**  
From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

### Example 3
**Input:**  
`x = 10`  
**Output:**  
`false`  
**Explanation:**  
Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

## Constraints
- \(-2^{31} \leq x \leq 2^{31} - 1\)
