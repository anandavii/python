# Armstrong Numbers Problem

[GFG Link for the Problem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/armstrong-numbers2727/1)

## Problem Statement
You are given a 3-digit number `n`. Find whether it is an Armstrong number or not.

An Armstrong number of three digits is a number such that the sum of the cubes of its digits is equal to the number itself. For example, 371 is an Armstrong number since \(3^3 + 7^3 + 1^3 = 371\).

**Note:** Return "Yes" if it is an Armstrong number, else return "No".

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input:**  
`n = 153`  
**Output:**  
`Yes`  
**Explanation:**  
153 is an Armstrong number since \(1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153\). Hence, the answer is "Yes".

### Example 2
**Input:**  
`n = 372`  
**Output:**  
`No`  
**Explanation:**  
372 is not an Armstrong number since \(3^3 + 7^3 + 2^3 = 378\). Hence, the answer is "No".

## Constraints
- \(100 \leq n < 1000\)

## Expected Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(1)
- **Auxiliary Space:** O(1)
